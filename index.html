      <h3>About</h3>
      Producer and MC J. Cole goes by Jermaine Lamar Cole at home. Born in Germany but raised in North Carolina, Cole grew up with a mother who loved rock and folk, a  father was a fan of hardcore hip-hop artists like 2Pac and Ice Cube, so his childhood revolved around a love for both basketball and rap music.
      Graduating high school in 2003, his grades were good enough to earn a scholarship, but hip-hop had taken hold of his life. Therefore, Cole made the decision to attend St. John's University on an academic scholarship in New York City, where he had a better chance of getting a record deal. He graduated magna cum laude with a degree in Communication and a minor in business. Upon graduation, Cole worked as a bill collector in the city, but he still had a passion his wanted to pursue, so he released his first mixtape, "The Come Up."
      With courage and determination, Cole stood outside Jay-Z's office building for days in hopes of giving him his demo. But when he was finally face to face with the rap star, the reception was well below chilly. To Cole's surpise, luck came not long before that.
      He was shocked then when he received a call from the man weeks later, and even more shocked when he got a chance to contribute to Jay-ZÂ’s 2009 effort The Blueprint 3. Cole was officially the first artist to be signed to Jay-Z's Roc Nation. "I got the record deal," Cole recalled, "but I still had to learn and improve as far as being ready to drop an album."
      Fast forward to 2014... J. Cole is named the first hip hop artist in 25 years to go platinum with no features on his album, Forest Hills Drive.
